        3) content - read- before:     add the workflow from #2
        (for more details see the screenshot "trigger.jpg")
        
        
X. Configuration:
=================

- Permissions:
  1) Create a "Moderator" Usergroup
  2) Create a "Moderator" Role
  3) Assign the Moderator Role to the Moderator Usergroup
  4) Edit the Moderator Role and add the Permissions:
        - "content/edit"    (forum_topic and forum_reply)
        - "content/remove"  (forum_topic and forum_reply)
        - "content/move"    (content_move)
        - "xrowforum/close" (closes and reopens forum topics)
     Assign a limitation to forum section or forumindex subtree for that role
     Edit one of your Moderator User and add some forum as related object which he should be able to administrate in future
     (you created that new "moderator" attribute earlier in step VIII)
     
  5) Edit the Member Role and add the Permissions:
        - "xrowforum/overview" (displays the statistic page)
        - "xrowforum/create" (allows to reply on forum topics)
        - "xrowforum/removeflag" (allows to remove ALL flags for a certain user)
        - "xrowforum/report" (allows to report a rule violation) 
		- "pm/*" (allows your user to use the whole PM module)
  
  6) Edit the Anonymous Usergroup and add "Content - Read - Section (Users)" permissions (required for birthdays)
  7) additional: give permissions to the moderator role to modify ranks in the backend ("xrowforum/ranks") and permissions to administrate forum via the backend ("xrowforum/settings")
  
- go to the backend and click on the "xrowForum" tab then on general settings and fill out the first 5 fields correctly! (ID settings)
- or navigate to http://"url"/"admin_siteaccess"/xrowforum/settings and fill out the first 5 fields correctly! (ID settings)


XI. about the Forumindex Node:
==============================

- This extension expects a forum tree which looks like: 1) "forumindex node"(no matter which class, suggested: folder) -> 2) forums -> 3) forum -> 4)forum_topic -> 5) forum_reply
- consider that when you select the forum index node!
- this extension also delivers a rough forum index template which u are able to activate in your overrides (check xrowforum/settings/siteaccess/eng/override.ini.append.php for that)
- don't activate that override condition if you don't use a special forumindex node above your forums! but again i recommand to use such a node!
- this override will activate a template which provides a couple of features, which you will loose if you dont activate it, such as statistic overview or the unflag all areas function
- look at "hierarchy.jpg" picture for a more visual explanation
